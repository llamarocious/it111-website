    <p3>Hi, I'm Trisha! I'm currently 19 years old and I'm a freshman at Batangas State University-Alangilan. BS in Computer Science is my chosen program. Nice to meet you!</p3>

    <p3>You know what I don't like? Bright and highly-saturated colors. When it comes to stuff I own, I prefer neutral colors and minimal designs. When it comes to music, though I've been a KPOP fan for more than 7 years now, I listen to other genres more these days. I don't focus on the genres that much. As long as the song is good, I'll like it. 

        <br> <br> <br> <br>
    GFRIEND's music will always be superior, by the way.</p3>

    <p3>Believe me when I say I'm emotional. I really am, perhaps even more than what you think. Why, you ask? I'm currently reading this story and it's getting real angsty now. I think I'll be depressed the moment I reach the end of it. I also cry more often compared to before. 
        <br> <br> <br>
    Is this what adulting feels like? </p3>
